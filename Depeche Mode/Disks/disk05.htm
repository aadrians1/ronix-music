     Girl of sixteen, whole life ahead of her<br>
     Slashed her wrists, bored with life<br>
     Didn't succeed, thank the Lord<br>
     For small mercies<br>
     Fighting back the tears, mother reads the note again<br>
     Sixteen candles burn in her mind<br>
     She takes the blame, it's always the same<br>
     She goes down on her knees and prays<br>
     I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours<br>
     But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor<br>
     And when I die I expect to find Him laughing<br>
     Girl of eighteen, fell in love with everything<br>
     Found new life in Jesus Christ<br>
     Hit by a car, ended up<br>
     On a life support machine<br>
     Summer's day, as she passed away<br>
     Birds were singing in the summer sky<br>
     Then came the rain, and once again<br>
     A tear fell from her mother's eye<br>
     I don't want to start any blasphemous rumours<br>
     But I think that God's got a sick sense of humor<br>
     And when I die I expect to find Him laughing<br>

     I want somebody to share<br>
     Share the rest of my life<br>
     Share my innermost thoughts<br>
     Know my intimate details<br>
     Someone who'll stand by my side<br>
     And give me support<br>
     And in return<br>
     She'll get my support<br>
     She will listen to me<br>
     When I want to speak<br>
     About the world we live in<br>
     And life in general<br>
     Though my views may be wrong<br>
     They may even be perverted<br>
     She'll hear me out<br>
     And won't easily be converted<br>
     To my way of thinking<br>
     In fact she'll often disagree<br>
     But at the end of it all<br>
     She will understand me<br>
     Aaaahhhhh....<br>
     I want somebody who cares<br>
     For me passionately<br>
     With every thought and<br>
     With every breath<br>
     Someone who'll help me see things<br>
     In a different light<br>
     All the things I detest<br>
     I will almost like<br>
     I don't want to be tied<br>
     To anyone's strings<br>
     I'm carefully trying to steer clear of<br>
     Those things<br>
     But when I'm asleep<br>
     I want somebody<br>
     Who will put their arms around me<br>
     And kiss me tenderly<br>
     Though things like this<br>
     Make me sick<br>
     In a case like this<br>
     I'll get away with it<br>
     Aaaahhhhh....<br>
