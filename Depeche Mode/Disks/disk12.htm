     Where heaven waits<br>
     Those golden gates<br>

     Oblivion<br>

     Your precious soul<br>

     I feel you<br>
     Your rising sun<br>
     My kingdom comes<br>
     I feel you<br>
     Each move you make<br>
     I feel you<br>
     Each breath you take<br>
     Where angels sing<br>
     And spread their wings<br>
     My love's on high<br>
     You take me home<br>
     To glory's throne<br>
     By and by<br>
     This is the morning of our love<br>
     It's just the dawning of our love<br>
