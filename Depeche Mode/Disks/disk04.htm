     You've got your leather boots on<br>

     For too little<br>

     Make me think<br>
     There's some truth in it<br>
     Promises made for convenience<br>
     Aren't necessarily<br>
     What we need<br>
     Truth is a word<br>
     That's lost its meaning<br>
     The truth has become<br>
     Merely half-truth<br>
     So lie to me<br>
     Like they do it in the factory<br>
     Make me think<br>
     That at the end of the day<br>
     Some great reward<br>
     Will be coming my way<br>

     You hear stories of old<br>
