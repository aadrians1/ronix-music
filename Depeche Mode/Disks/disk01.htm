     She was silent trying to be<br>
     Like the girl who acted on the TV<br>
     Always knowing when to say<br>
     Wishing for a moment so that they could see<br>
     Staring in the night<br>
     A picture in my room<br>
     And I think that she knew her lines<br>
     Break away tonight<br>
     I wanna hold your hand<br>
     We've got to get it right<br>
     We've got to understand<br>
     Carefully watching waiting as I<br>
     Stood upon the back streets and we start to play<br>
     I was screaming louder as the<br>
     Curtains fall between us in a twisted way<br>
     Staring in the night<br>
     A picture in my room<br>
     And I think that she knew her lines<br>
     Break away tonight<br>
     I wanna hold your hand<br>
     We've got to get it right<br>
     We've got to understand<br>
     Placing all the questions in the<br>
     Minutes of a game we won so long ago<br>
     Dangerous and beautiful the<br>
     Radio transmission that I have to know<br>
     You could never run<br>
     You could never stay<br>
     And I think you belong to me<br>
     Break away tonight<br>
     I wanna hold your hand<br>
     We've got to get it right<br>
     We've got to understand<br>

     When I'm with you baby, I go out of my head<br>
     And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough<br>
     All the things you do to me and everything you said<br>
     And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough<br>
     We slip and slide as we fall in love<br>
     And I just can't seem to get enough<br>
     We walk together, we're walking down the street<br>
     And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough<br>
     Every time I think of you I know we have to meet<br>
     And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough<br>
     It's getting hotter, it's our burning love<br>
     And I just can't seem to get enough<br>
     And when it rains, you're shining down for me<br>
     And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough<br>
     Just like a rainbow you know you set me free<br>
     And I just can't get enough, I just can't get enough<br>
     You're like an angel and you give me your love<br>
     And I just can't seem to get enough<br>
