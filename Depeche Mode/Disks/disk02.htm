     I've told myself so many times before<br>
     But this time I think I mean it for sure<br>
     We have reached a full stop<br>
     Nothing's gonna save us from the big drop<br>
     Reached our natural conclusion<br>
     Outlived the illusion<br>
     I hate being in these situations<br>
     That call for diplomatic relations<br>
     If I only knew the answer<br>
     Or I thought we had a chance<br>
     Or I could stop this<br>
     I would stop this thing from spreading like a cancer<br>
     What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore<br>
     What can I say? I'm heading for the door<br>
     I can't stand this emotional violence<br>
     Leave in silence<br>
     We've been running around in circles all year<br>
     Doing this and that and getting nowhere<br>
     This'll be the last time<br>
     (I think I said that last time)<br>
     If I only had a potion,<br>
     Some magical lotion<br>
     That could stop this, I would stop this<br>
     I would set the wheels in motion<br>
     What can I say? (I don't want to play) anymore<br>

     It all seems so absurd that this should have occurred<br>

     No, my secret garden's not so secret anymore<br>
     Run through the fields down to the edge of the water<br>
     Can't stay long, here comes the reason why<br>
     She'll catch me if she can, take me by the hand<br>
     I'll have to keep on running and I just can't see the fun in<br>
     My secret garden not being secret anymore<br>
     It used to be so easy on days such as these she'd<br>
     Search and search for hours, in among the flowers<br>
     I loved it, I loved her<br>
     Play the fool, act so cruel (I loved it)<br>
     Read a book, take a look (I loved her)<br>

     When the site was found we laid the foundations down<br>

     Don't build at night, you need a little light<br>
     How else you gonna see what it's gonna be like?<br>
     So we picked up our tools and we worked in the morning light<br>
     With the last stone placed wasn't it a wonderful sight?<br>
     But it fell back down and scattered all around<br>
     Anything passes when you need glasses<br>

     I just want to see your sweet smile<br>

     And sit on a bench for a while<br>
     I treasure the way we used to laugh and play<br>
     And look in each others eyes<br>
     You can keep me at a distance if you don't trust my resistance<br>

     All I want to do is see you<br>
     Don't you know that it's true<br>
     Well I know five years is a long time<br>
     And that times change (oh that times change)<br>
     But I think that you will find<br>
     People are basically the same (basically the same)<br>
     If the water's still flowing, we can go for a swim<br>
     And do the things we used to do<br>
     And if I'm reluctant you can pull me in<br>
     And we can relive our youth<br>
     Oh but we'll stay friendly like sister and brother<br>
     Though I think I still love you<br>

     Love seems something like wanting a scar<br>

     I've never been in love before<br>
     Next I asked several friends of mine<br>
     If they could spare a few minutes of their time<br>
     Their look suggested that I'd lost my mind<br>
